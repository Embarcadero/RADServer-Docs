## Chapter 4: REST Debugger

Don't forget to [watch the video](https://youtu.be/c7KFvP8nF7Q) of this chapter. 

[REST Debugger](https://www.embarcadero.com/free-tools/rest-debugger) is Embarcadero's free solution for exploring, understanding, and integrating RESTful web services with Delphi and C++Builder apps. It empowers developers to explore, test, and ultimately understand how a RESTful web service works with features such as filterable JSON blobs, streamlined OAuth 1.0/2.0 authentication, and configurable request/resource parameters. Not only that, but also offers you the possibility to copy and paste REST components directly into your projects in just a few clicks. 

This chapter uses the REST Debugger that comes with RAD Studio and you can find under Tools/REST Debugger. To test some endpoints the RAD Server example from chapter 3 will be used.
