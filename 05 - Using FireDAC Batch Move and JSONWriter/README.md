## Chapter 5: Using FireDAC Batch Move and JSONWriter

Don't forget to [watch the video](https://youtu.be/Rs3QpUGjrW4) of this chapter. 

Depending on the requirements for your projects or what technology you are more familiar with, RAD Studio allows you to use even more tools to create your REST API. 

FireDAC components are available to produce and consume a stream containing database metadata and data encoded in JSON for a response from one of your RAD Server endpoints. This approach is great if your client applications are going to be VCL or FMX. You can use MemoryTables to automatically map all the database information and metadata to map it automatically. Other client applications that use languages, like JavaScript, could have a problem dealing with the database information and data that would be included in the response, but  RAD Studio provides a way to generate clean JSON that JavaScript or other languages would expect to receive.

In the demo files you'll find different examples of using this set of components and methods.
