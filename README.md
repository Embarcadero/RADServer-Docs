## What is RAD Server?

[![RAD Server Screen Shot][product-screenshot]][radserver-url]

RAD Server is a turn-key application foundation for rapidly building and deploying services based applications. RAD Server enables developers to quickly build new application back-ends or migrate existing Delphi or C++ client/server business logic to a modern services based architecture that is open, stateless, secure and scalable.

RAD Server is easy to develop, deploy and operate making it ideally suited for ISVs and OEMs building re-deployable solutions. RAD Server allows you to take your existing code and convert it to REST API endpoints.

## About this documentation

This repository is the **part 1** of an updated version of the original white paper about RAD Server written by David Intersimone. The whole document is beeing updated and some brand new chapters have been introduced.

For a more concise and aprocheable learning process, each chapter has been split in different folders. Inside each one you will find:

- `README.md` file with a summary of the chapter and a video link to YouTube (each chapter has a explaining video)
- `Demo projects` for Delphi and C++ (if the chapter requires demos)

## Prerequisites

For following this documentation correctly you will need:

- Delphi or C++ Enterprise/Architect
- InterBase Developer edition

## How to download the whole documentation

You can find chapter 1 of the documentation in the folder in this repository. If you want to download for free all the chapters, you just need to access [this link][new-docs-url].

## How to download the examples

You can just click the ![code button][code-button] button on this repository and download the whole project, but we recommend you to clone the repository to get future updates in a faster and simpler way.

#### Clone the repo

```sh
git clone https://github.com/embarcadero/radserver-docs.git
```

## Videos

We have created a video for each chapter. You can find the link to every specific chapter inside its README.md in the folder, but you can also access the whole playlist [here][yt-playlist-url].

## Roadmap

Currently we have launched a first batch of 10 chapters that will help to understand and start using RAD Server. Our plan is to keep releasing new chapters in a regular basis, update the documentation and include the examples in this repository.

## FAQ

### How do I get a license of RAD Server?

Depending on the RAD Studio license you own maybe you are elegible for a RAD Server license already. Also, RAD Server Lite is free for any Enterprise/Architect owner. Contact your sales rep for more info.

### Can I suggest a topic for a future chapter?

Absolutely. We are constantly working in uplading more content to this repository with extra chapters. If you'd like to see anything in particular, [open an issue][issues-url] and suggest it.

### I have a problem with RAD Server. Can I report it in this repo?

No, this is no the right place for that. If you have any questions or requests regarding the product, you should [contact support][support-url].

### I've came up with an idea that would be interesting for the demos. Can I send a pull request?

We would prefer if you open an issue first, but if for example, you detect a bug on the code or you think that a demo could be improved, feel free to send a PR and we will analyze it.
