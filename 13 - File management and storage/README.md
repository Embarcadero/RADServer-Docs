## Chapter 13: File management and storage

Don't forget to [watch the video](https://youtu.be/_PAFOdDklTo) of this chapter. 

In this chapter, we will analyze multiple ways that RAD Server offers to manage files and access infrastructure storage. Also, we will see how we can specify the types of files that each endpoint can produce or consume globally or define it in a granular way on each endpoint. 

This sample shows how to use the component TEMSFileResource as well as how to access files sent directly in the body of a request.
