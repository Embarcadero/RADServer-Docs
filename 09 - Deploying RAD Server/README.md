This chapter covers the multiple platforms where you can deploy RAD Server in production: Windows, Linux and Docker. If you are interested in RAD Server Lite, jump to the next chapter.

The easiest way to deploy RAD Server in production is using the installers you can find on GetIt. You will find one for Windows and another one for Linux.

For manual deployment, even though conceptually speaking all the platforms use the same foundation, the deployments can differ a bit. For this chapter you will find 3 different videos, one for each platform.
