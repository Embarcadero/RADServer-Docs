## Chapter 8: Accessing the built-in analytics

Don't forget to [watch the video](https://youtu.be/uDntdmokIyE) of this chapter. 

The RAD Server Console is a service that provides a pre-configured web application which displays multiple data as well as analytics from the RAD Server Engine. It allows you to have a more in-depth view of the activity on your RAD Server instances and make decisions based on real data. Analyze user, API, and services activity to gain insight into how your application is being utilized.

This chapter has no demo files because you can access to the dev console from any RAD Server project. In the dev server window click on the **Open Console** button and an instance of the console will be run on, by default, port 8081.
